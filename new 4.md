lac - Implement IAM roles and policies using CloudFormation or Terraform with least privilege principles for Batch job queues, compute environments, and job definitions 

basic, least-privilege Terraform module to implement IAM roles and policies for AWS Batch resources: 

* Job Queues
* Compute Environments
* Job Definitions
* It adheres to least privilege by only allowing required actions, scoped to relevant resources.
# Least Privilege Notes:
* ECS actions (RunTask, DescribeTasks, etc.) are necessary if Batch jobs run containers.
* CloudWatch permissions limited to specific log group ARN.
* EC2 describes are needed by Batch to place jobs in VPC compute environments.
